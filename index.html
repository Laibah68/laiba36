          <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Online learning involves courses offered by primary institutions that are 100% virtual.
            Online learning, or virtual classes offered over the internet, is contrasted with traditional courses taken in a 
            brick-and-mortar school building. It is a development in distance education that expanded in the 1990s with the spread
            of the commercial Internet and the World Wide Web. The learner experience is typically asynchronous but may also 
            incorporate synchronous elements. The vast majority of institutions utilize a learning management system for the 
            administration of online courses. As theories of distance education evolve, digital technologies to support learning and 
            pedagogy continue to transform as well.</p></div>

            and Human Development at The George Washington University, offered a Master's degree beginning in 1992. The program, 
            developed by Dr. William Lynch, originally delivered course content in association with Jones Intercable's Mind Extension 
            University (ME/U). Classes were broadcast via satellite late at night, and student communicated through a Bulletin Board 
            system.</p></div>

          <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Online credentials for learning are digital credentials that are offered in place of
           traditional paper credentials for a skill or educational achievement. Directly linked to the accelerated development of 
           internet communication technologies, the development of digital badges, electronic passports and massive open online courses 
           (MOOCs) have a very direct bearing on our understanding of learning, recognition and levels as they pose a direct challenge 
           to the status quo. It is useful to distinguish between three forms of online credentials: Test-based credentials, 
           online badges, and online certificates.</p></div>
